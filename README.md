# Legacy of Fire and Shadow (working title)
#### Version: early development

## Description
<p>Dungeon crawling project inspired by the early 2000s era of gaming using the open-source DarkBASIC Pro language and compiler.<p>

<p>All textures, models, sounds etc are currently used from the free media and assets that came with the DVD. These are placeholders for now until I either make my own or buy some.<p>
