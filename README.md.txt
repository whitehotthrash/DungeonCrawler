#Dungeon Crawler
#### Version: early development

## Description
<p>This is a self-teaching project where I am attempting to build a game similar to one I played as a kid back in 2002. It's a simple dungeon crawler using the now open-source DarkBASIC Pro language and compiler - though, my copy is legitimate from a DVD with a serial key.<p>

<p>All textures, models, sounds etc are currently used from the free media that came with the DVD. These are placeholders for now until I either make my own or buy some.<p>
